## 💬 Conversation History Settings

### **How It Works:**

**Example with 10 Messages (Default):**
```
Customer asks: "What are your services?"
AI sees:
- Last 10 messages from this customer
- Current question
- Your business information

AI responds with full context!
```

### **Choosing the Right Number:**

**1-3 Messages:** ⚡⚡⚡
- Very fast
- Minimal context
- Good for simple queries only
- Not recommended for conversations

**5-10 Messages:** ⚡⚡ ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Fast enough
- Good context
- Handles conversations well
- Optimal balance

**15-25 Messages:** ⚡
- Slower
- Excellent context
- Great for complex discussions

- May cause timeouts
- Only for special needs

**Default: 10 messages** (perfect for most uses!)
